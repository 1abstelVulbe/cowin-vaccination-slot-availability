## Uninstall XE5 in Windows
 
Before installing the update, you need to uninstall the previous version of Delphi XE5 in Windows. To do that, follow these steps:
 
- Select "Control Panel | Programs and Features"
- Right-click "Embarcadero RAD Studio XE5" and select Uninstall
- With Remove selected, click "Next" (3 times)
- Click "Finish" when done

## Rehost Licenses on AppWave Server
 
The update requires rehosting your licenses on the AppWave Server. To do that, follow these steps:

- On the AppWave Server open your web browser and type the URL: https://localhost:<port>/aaserver (no need to specify port if default 80)</port>
- In the top left, click "ADMIN"
- Under MANAGE LICENSES select "License Inventory"
- Click "Retrieve Licenses" button
- If your Login Name, Password, and Host Address are already filled in they are likely correct. Just enter the Certificate Number(s) you wish to refresh, then click "Retrieve". If you cannot find this information it was contained in the certificate e-mail(s) we sent with your license(s). If you search the subject line of your e-mails with the term "certificate", you should see them. You may need to ask your primary contact for this information (i.e. person on the order and typically from purchasing, finance, or executive staff at your organization).
- You should get a message that "This license already exists" and that is ok. Click "Host Selected Licenses" and your licenses will be updated[^1^].

## Download and Install Delphi XE5 Update 2
 
After rehosting your licenses, you can download and install Delphi XE5 Update 2 from the AppWave Browser. To do that, follow these steps:

- Open AppWave Browser
- Select "Apps | All Apps"
- Find "Delphi XE5 (Update 2) Installer in English for Windows". If you do not see it, make sure you update your catalog [optional steps below]
- Check the CheckBox next to that and click the "Cache Apps" button to start download
- Once downloaded, click "Install" button to start installation
- Follow the installation wizard instructions

You can also download and install C++Builder XE5 Update 2 if you need it by selecting "C++Builder" once the installer starts.
  
### [Optional] How to Update Catalog
 
If you do not see the update in your AppWave Browser, you may need to update your catalog. To do that, follow these steps:

- Select "Apps | Catalog"
- Select "Update Catalog Now"
- Select "Yes" when prompted to confirm
- Wait for the catalog update to finish

#### [Optional] How to Apply Hotfix 3
 
If you encounter any issues with JPEG support after installing the update, you may need to apply Hotfix 3. To do that, follow these steps:

- Download Hotfix 3 from [here\[^3^\]](http://cc.embarcadero.com/Item/29675)
- Unzip and copy the files to your RAD Studio lib\\win32\\debug folder
